- 👋 <h1>Hi, I’m justz72</h1>.
- 👀 I'm interested in learning programming languages for the time being to increase my skillset and knowledge for my career as a software/game developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML AND CSS on Udemy and looking forward to learn more programming languages and to kickstart my career in software development/engineering and then as a game developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making websites and applications(for now) and later do some projects on making video games.
